<objective>
Display a rich progress report with statusline, recent task completions, current position, and routing to the next action. Equivalent to /wtfp:progress but for research workflow.
</objective>

<process>

## 1. Validate

```bash
[ ! -f .research/RESEARCH.md ] && echo "No research project. Run /wtfMS:identify-research." && exit 0
cat .research/STATE.md 2>/dev/null
cat .research/WORKFLOW.md 2>/dev/null
cat .research/RESEARCH.md 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

## 2. Build Statusline

```
WTF-MS ► [N]/[total] tasks ◆ [phase: exploring|reviewing|executing|writing] ► [domain]
```

Display this first, before all other output.

## 3. Calculate Progress Metrics

From WORKFLOW.md, count:
- Total active tasks
- Complete tasks (☑ complete)
- In-progress tasks
- Pending tasks
- Archived tasks

Determine current phase:
- No LITERATURE.md → "exploring"
- LITERATURE.md exists, no WORKFLOW.md → "reviewing"
- WORKFLOW.md exists, tasks pending → "executing"
- All tasks complete → "writing"

## 4. Show Recent Work

Find task output files modified in the last 7 days:
```bash
find .research/tasks/ -newer .research/RESEARCH.md -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

Show 1-line summary of recent task completions.

## 5. Display Progress Report

```
WTF-MS ► [statusline]

# [Research Prompt]

**Phase:**    [exploring | reviewing | executing | writing]
**Progress:** [████████░░] [N]/[total] tasks
**Domain:**   [domain + sub-field]

## Recent Work
- Task [N] ([name]): [1-line output summary]

## Current Position
[Next pending task or current state]

## Key Decisions Made
[from STATE.md]

## Open Questions
[unresolved assumptions or decisions from WORKFLOW.md]
```

## 6. Route to Next Action

**Phase = exploring:** → `/wtfMS:literature-review`
**Phase = reviewing:** → `/wtfMS:define-research-tasks`
**Phase = executing, task in-progress:** → `/wtfMS:execute-task [N]`
**Phase = executing, next pending task:** → `/wtfMS:execute-task [N+1]`
**Phase = writing:** → `/wtfMS:wtfp` or `/wtfp:progress`

Show routed command clearly and offer to run it.

</process>
