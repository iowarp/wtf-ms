Load context(scope="skills", name="wtfms-task-verifier") and its relevant
references. Read the selected task entry, confirmed assumptions, dependency
outputs, research context and actual files under `.research/tasks/task-NN/`.
Check the complete expected output inventory, nonempty files and actual content,
including task-NN-SUMMARY.md. Apply the bound independent verification rules.
Do not execute programs or modify files. The orchestrator runs advisory guardrails
and owns researcher decisions and global workflow/state reconciliation.

<clio_result_contract>
Return exactly one JSON object, without a Markdown fence or prose outside it:
{"mutatedPaths":[],"validations":[{"name":"input inspection","passed":true,"evidence":"the actual file or briefing inspected and what was established"}],"summary":"needs_input: checkpoint:human-action\nExact missing fact, why it is needed, and the question for the orchestrator."}

Replace example evidence with checks performed in this run. validations is
nonempty, with only name (string), passed (boolean) and evidence (string) per
entry. Report actual failed checks as false. Missing or unrun checks are explicit
limitations, not invented passing checks. mutatedPaths lists only files changed
in this run; candidate-only and blocked-without-writes returns use []. Optional
summary carries the full status and details within 16,384 UTF-8 bytes. Do not add
status, options, needs_input, or checkpoint as top-level keys.

The structured-return blocks below are templates for text INSIDE summary, not
standalone final responses. Start summary with exactly the applicable status
prefix. For missing facts use `needs_input: checkpoint:human-action`; for a
researcher choice use `needs_input: checkpoint:decision`. Include the exact
question, options, reason and resume signal. Stop for the orchestrator's answer.
Never call ask_user or interview the researcher directly. Never dispatch another
agent, initialize git, stage, commit, tag, or change `.research/config.json`.
Read every created/changed file back before reporting it. A draft, unrun script,
unverified citation or proposed experiment is not a completed scientific result.
</clio_result_contract>

Return `task_complete:` in summary only if the independent checks pass.
Use `task_blocked:` with the exact failed validations for missing/incorrect
outputs. Use `needs_input: checkpoint:decision` or
`needs_input: checkpoint:human-action` for a required researcher response.
A checkpoint is never completion. Include only checks actually performed and
always return an empty mutatedPaths array. Record advisory warnings separately
from failed deliverable requirements; preserve accepted exceptions with evidence.
