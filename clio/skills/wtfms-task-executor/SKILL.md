# Canonical task output contracts

The five per-type file contracts and format blocks below are copied verbatim
from the restored canonical executor. The literature retrieval steps use Clio
tools; the scientific output contracts are unchanged.


<clio_output_scope>
Apply the output contracts below within the caller's explicit write grant.
Update `.research/LITERATURE.md` only when that path is authorized; otherwise put
proposed updates in the task summary for the orchestrator. Record actual supplied
files and provided URLs inspected in Sources Reviewed. Never represent generated
protocols, scripts or figure descriptions as performed experiments or measured
results. The orchestrator handles writing tasks through `/wtfMS:wtfp`.
</clio_output_scope>

When spawned, read the `<task>` block and identify its **type**. Execution behavior differs by type:

---

## Type: `literature`

**What you do:** Read supplied materials and researcher-provided URLs, then synthesize papers on the task topic.

**Execution:**
1. Read `<data_files>` first: every registered paper, BibTeX file, or note relevant to this task is the primary corpus. Read each one before searching anything.
2. If `<web_allowed>` is true, config permits fetching, and web_fetch is available, fetch only the specific URLs the researcher provided in `<provided_urls>`. Clio has no web search tool. If fetching is disabled/unavailable or no URLs were supplied, work from the supplied materials and record that coverage in Sources Reviewed. Request missing sources through a checkpoint rather than inventing papers or search results.
3. Use web_fetch to inspect the provided abstract/full-text URL and record the actual inspection depth and provenance. Supplied files come first; do not claim a PDF was read when only its filename or metadata was accessible.
4. Synthesize findings into a structured summary
5. Identify which papers are most relevant to the research gap
6. Quote every paper title in the summary and put a DOI in the BibTeX entry when known. Never invent bibliographic details; mark uncertain entries `[unverified]`. The orchestrator runs a Crossref check and shows flags to the researcher.

**Output files:**
- `task-NN-literature-summary.md` — structured synthesis by sub-topic
- `task-NN-references.bib` — BibTeX entries for key papers (formatted correctly)
- Updates to `.research/LITERATURE.md` if new gaps found

**Output format in summary:**
```markdown
# Literature Summary: [task name]

## Key Findings by Sub-topic

### [Sub-topic]
[synthesis — what is known, what is debated]

## Most Relevant Papers
| Paper | Relevance | Key Finding |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| [ref] | [HIGH/MED] | [1 line] |

## New Gaps Identified
[Any gaps found that weren't in the original LITERATURE.md]
```

---

## Type: `experimental`

**What you do:** Generate a detailed experimental protocol and data recording template.

**Execution:**
1. Read task description, assumptions, and expected outputs from WORKFLOW.md
2. Generate a step-by-step experimental protocol appropriate to the material and measurement
3. Include: safety considerations, equipment settings, sample preparation steps, measurement procedure, data recording format
4. Generate a data recording template (spreadsheet structure or table)
5. Flag any assumption that needs verification before lab work begins

**Output files:**
- `task-NN-protocol.md` — detailed experimental protocol
- `task-NN-data-template.md` — data recording structure with column headers and units
- `task-NN-checklist.md` — pre-experiment verification checklist

**Protocol format:**
```markdown
# Experimental Protocol: [task name]

## Safety Notes
[relevant hazards — chemicals, high voltage, high temperature, etc.]

## Materials and Equipment
- [list with specifications]

## Sample Preparation
Step 1: [action] — [expected result] — [how to verify]
Step 2: ...

## Measurement Procedure
Step 1: [action] — [parameters] — [what to record]

## Data to Record
[table with: measurement, units, conditions, notes column]

## Expected Results
[from task assumptions — what would confirm success]

## Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
```

## Type: `computational`

**What you do:** Generate simulation/calculation input files and analysis scripts.

**Execution:**
1. Read task assumptions for: method, software, system, parameters
2. Generate appropriate input files or scripts for the specified software
3. Include convergence testing guidance
4. Generate post-processing analysis script

**Supported methods and outputs:**
- DFT (VASP/QE): INCAR, POSCAR, KPOINTS, POTCAR instructions, submission script
- MD (LAMMPS): input script, force field notes, analysis scripts (OVITO/MDAnalysis)
- Phase-field: parameter file + solver notes
- CALPHAD: Thermo-Calc/Pandat script outline
- High-throughput: screening workflow script (Python + Materials Project API)

**Output files:**
- `task-NN-input/` — input files or templates
- `task-NN-run.sh` — job submission script (SLURM or local)
- `task-NN-analysis.py` — post-processing script
- `task-NN-README.md` — how to run + expected outputs

---

## Type: `data-analysis`

**What you do:** Analyze uploaded data files and produce figures and results summary.

**Execution:**
1. Read DATA-INDEX.md to find relevant data files for this task
2. Inspect data structure (headers, units, data types)
3. Write analysis code appropriate to the data type:
   - Mechanical test data (stress-strain): Young's modulus, yield stress, UTS extraction
   - XRD data: peak identification, lattice parameter extraction, Rietveld outline
   - EIS data: equivalent circuit fitting outline
   - Microstructure images: grain size analysis, phase fraction outline
   - Computational output: energy, force, trajectory analysis
4. Generate figures with proper labels, units, and scientific formatting

**Output files:**
- `task-NN-analysis.py` (or .m for MATLAB) — analysis code
- `task-NN-results-summary.md` — key numerical results with uncertainty estimates
- `task-NN-figures/` — placeholder descriptions for each figure (actual generation requires running the code)

**Results summary format:**
```markdown
# Results: [task name]

## Key Numerical Results
| Quantity | Value | Uncertainty | Units | Method |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| [e.g., Yield stress] | [X] | [±Y] | [MPa] | [0.2% offset] |

## Comparison to Expectations
[from task assumptions — did results match, exceed, fall short?]

## Anomalies or Concerns
[anything unexpected that needs investigation]
```

---

## Type: `analytical`

**What you do:** Develop mathematical models, derive equations, validate against theory or data.

**Execution:**
1. Identify the physical model appropriate to the task
2. State assumptions and governing equations
3. Derive/adapt the model for the specific material system
4. Validate against known limits or available data
5. Identify the parameter sensitivity (which inputs matter most)

**Output files:**
- `task-NN-model.md` — derivation, equations, assumptions, validity range
- `task-NN-validation.md` — comparison to limiting cases or data
- `task-NN-implementation.py` — numerical implementation if needed

<clio_retrieval>
For literature work, inspect `.research/data/` and DATA-INDEX.md before other
research inputs or any network access. Read supplied papers, bibliographies and
notes first. If a binary/PDF cannot be read with available tools, record its path
and access limit and return a checkpoint for usable text when it blocks the task.
Do not claim full-text inspection from metadata or a filename.
Use web_fetch only for specific URLs the researcher supplied in <provided_urls>
and only when <web_allowed> is true and config does not set web_search false.
Clio has no web search tool. Do not invent URLs, issue search-provider queries,
or use bash as a search workaround. Record supplied files actually inspected,
URLs actually fetched, failed/unreadable sources and the restricted coverage in
Sources Reviewed. Missing coverage is not evidence that no literature exists.
